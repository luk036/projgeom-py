ProjectivePlane Class and Projective Geometry Functions

This code defines a ProjectivePlane class and several functions related to projective geometry. The purpose of this code is to provide a framework for working with points and lines in a projective plane, which is a concept in mathematics.

The ProjectivePlane class is an abstract base class that defines the basic operations and properties of objects in a projective plane. It doesn't take any direct inputs or produce outputs on its own, but it sets up the structure for other classes to inherit from and implement these operations.

The class defines several abstract methods that need to be implemented by any concrete subclass:

- dual(): Returns the dual of the object (e.g., the dual of a point is a line, and vice versa)
- meet(): Finds the intersection of two objects
- aux(): Returns a dual object not incident with the current object
- dot(): Performs a basic measurement operation
- parametrize(): Creates a new object on the line through two given points
- incident(): Checks if two objects are incident (i.e., if a point lies on a line)

The code also defines several standalone functions that work with ProjectivePlane objects:

1. check_axiom(): Verifies basic properties of projective geometry, such as the commutativity of equality and incidence.

2. coincident(): Checks if three points are collinear (lie on the same line).

3. check_pappus(): Implements Pappus's hexagon theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in projective geometry.

4. tri_dual(): Computes the dual of a triangle (the lines formed by its sides).

5. persp(): Checks if two triangles are in perspective (their corresponding sides intersect at collinear points).

6. check_desargue(): Implements Desargues's theorem, another important result in projective geometry.

7. harm_conj(): Calculates the harmonic conjugate of three collinear points.

8. involution(): Performs an involution transformation on a point with respect to an origin and a mirror line.

These functions take various combinations of Point and Line objects (which are type aliases for ProjectivePlane) as inputs and typically return boolean values or new Point/Line objects as outputs.

The code achieves its purpose by providing a structured way to represent and manipulate geometric objects in a projective plane. It uses abstract methods to define the interface for working with these objects, and then implements higher-level geometric operations using these basic methods. The logic flows from simple operations like checking if points are incident with lines, to more complex geometric constructions and theorems.

This code serves as a foundation for implementing and exploring projective geometry concepts in a programming environment. It allows users to create geometric objects, perform basic operations on them, and verify important theorems in projective geometry.
